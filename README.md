# linux-scripting
 A collection of scripts created whilst learning Bash/C-shell scripting.

 ## Packages
 Please note that, in order for certain scripts to function properly (particularly the 'greeting.sh' script), certain packages should be installed as a prerequisite, such as the 'ncal' and 'curl' packages.

 You can use the following commands to begin with: 
 ```
sudo apt install ncal
sudo apt install curl
 ```

## 'greeting.sh'
'greeting.sh is meant to be run as soon as your terminal window opens.  For this to be accomplished, please grant execution permission to the script (should you run into any related issues) using `chmod +x <path>/greeting.sh`.  Then, enter the full path to 'greeting.sh' at the end of your `.bashrc` file, located at `/home/<your_username>/.bashrc`.
